  ## why databae

  It started as a joke actually. Me being a mega nerd I was telling a developer friend who doesn't work with databases
  the bit of trivia that both schemas and schemata are the correct plural of schema for a database.

  "What is the plural of databases?" they wondered, and I deadpanned "Databae or databi"

  More seriously, since getting thrown into databases in my first big kid developer job, they've grown on me quite a bit. We
  had a rocky start, but things have come a long way from there.

  ## new site who dis

  My name is Joy although I use my initals professionally (JT) and there is a whole additional camp of people who know me by
  my handle, JTK.

  I'm a Baltimore native (hon), and after spending some time in the DC area I settled in North Carolina a few years back and
  I love it.

  I'm an avid traveler, giant book nerd, and professionally I love Python, SQL, Node, and Vue.js. When free time presents itself
  I enjoy learning new things. Next up is probably Go.
